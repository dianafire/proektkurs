					<h2>My life until now in a few words: </h2>
				</header>

				<article class="justify">
					<p>I was born in Plovdiv in 1985. I lived there until I finished highschool in 2004. Then I moved to Sofia where I had studied "Fire safety" at Ministry of Interior Academy for 4 years.</p>
					<p>I have been working at Fire Safety Directorate General as chief fire safety and civil protection inspector for almost 7 years now.</p>
					<p>I'm married and have no kids yet.</p>

					<p><strong>My favourite things to do are:</strong></p>
					<ol>
						<li >Most of all I love spending time with my husband and our friends;</li>
						<li>I like having long walks in the park in summer evenings;</li>
						<li>I like reading books but unfortunately I just haven't enough time for this kind of activity lately;</li>
						<li>Recently coding has turned into a hobby because I find it very interesting;</li>
						<li>And of course as every normal woman I love shoping.</li>

					</ol>
